        <h2>Summary</h2><br>
        <p>“Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener (pp. 43 – 80), entails about how Michael was enlightened by Charlie who provided him lifelong lessons about how to set plans and goals to accomplish. Initially, Michael faced challenges in his professional career because of his attitude, viewpoints in life, and his associations with some people. He was willing to seek advice from Charlie to improve himself. Firstly, Charlie taught Michael that dotting down goals is a powerful start towards growth. The next lesson was to categorize his goals in terms of the expected time frame. The impact was that the wheels started turning in the right direction for him. However, Michael had to consider cutting his ties with close friends, in order to elevate himself to new heights. In conclusion, Michael learned that the experience gained from the journey towards achieving a goal is far more valuable than the goal itself and makes necessary sacrifices to meet that goal.

        <h2>What I learned from the story?</h2>
        <p>I learned that life is not smooth sailing. I am acknowledging that and putting 
          in plans on who I want to be, where I want to be, the people who can elevate me, and what I want to continue learning will place me on the path of success.
        </p><br>
