            <h2>How would I describe myself?</h2><br>
            <p>I am a hardworking individual, who tries to have an 
                understanding of others based on their perspective. 
                I am also a fast learner and I love doing stuff related 
                to tech or graphic design. In most situations, I tend to be calm and reasonable. 
                However, sometimes I overthink some matters 
                and I may be a perfectionist at times.</p><br>
            <p>My strongest trait is resilience. I have continuously surpassed my limits on how much I can accomplish within a short span of time.
                My drive and hunger for success is growing with each challenge that awaits me.
                This translates to my academic life to enable me to do what is necessary to complete all assignments and tasks.
                This means to adjust study time table, change study methods, sacrifice sleep, and arrangements with people. 
            </p><br>
            <p>My strongest hobby is programming. I learn how to be efficient and productive from it. 
                For instance, I practice the short cut commands on the keyboard to
                 reduce the time it takes to finish tasks. Furthermore, 
                 I have done various projects that exposures me to new concepts. This impacts my academic life to allow me to work smarter and not harder and become adaptable to change. 
            </p>

             <h2>My Hero is CoryxKenshin</h2>
            <br>
            <p> CoryxKenshin is a YouTuber known for his playthroughs and reactions on YouTube. The reason I selected 
                him as my hero is because he is inspiring, charismatic, and a humble individual, 
                who has worked relentlessly to obtain the large following he has today.
                He taught me that consistency and dedication to your goals can make you successful in life. 
                I have watched his content since he was a small YouTuber, and now he is currently one of the biggest influencer in the genre of gaming on Youtube.
                The vibes and positive energy radiating from him has taught me to smile and be cheerful. He created a safe space that has helped me to sit back, relax, and enjoy myself.
                Importantly, I have been motivated to embark on my own YouTube journey while pursuing my degree because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CoryxKenshin">CoryxKenshin</a>.
                I understand that it is not easy, but I want to have no regrets doing something I like, which is gaming content.

            <p>The <a href="http://www.keirsey.com">Keirsey</a> Personality Test is a test that poses a series of questions to the user.
                Based on truthful input, it may ascertain the personality and traits of the user. Prior to the test, I was 
                instructed to choose options that automatically feels relatable to me and to not think too hard on what to pick.
                During the test, I was asked numerous of simple questions, and I answered honestly to them. 
                The scenarios were unbiased and kept all options to two, which made the process fast and smooth.<br><br>
                Guardian was my result. The website clarified what this meant by using keywords, 
                quotes, statistics, characteristics, and symbols associated with Guardian. 
                I believe it is valid because it presents a lot 
                of reliable information to the user. In my case, it surprised me how accurate 
                the results are as it described me as the following: factual, cautious, respectable, dependable, and logical.
